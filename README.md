# What is LegacyMC

LegacyMC is a launcher I am currently working on that has all the Minecraft
Beta, Alpha, Infdev, Indev, Classic and Pre-Classic versions of the game.
It's not just a launcher on the website you can get the server software for
all these versions PLUS the craftbukkit server software for Minecraft Beta
PLUS some archived plugins, LegacyMC is mainly something that brings back
Golden Age Minecraft!

# AUTHENCATION

There will be no authencation to a microsoft account since all versions
before the full release, version 1.0 are free so anyone that can not afford
Minecraft or just wants to have a Legacy Style Launcher then this launcher
you. Since there is no authencation sadly you can not play on servers because
it just does not work with everybody having the same name, but in the future I
may add a authencation system if you want to sign in to a microsoft account to
play on multiplayer servers.


# FUTURE PLANS

For this launcher my plans are to make it to were you can play on multiplayer
servers at some point, but my main plan at the moment is getting the launcher in
a stable state where you and everybody can download it and enjoy golden age minecraft
versions I also plan to have a feature where in the launcher there is a server list
where you can put in the server ip and it look like modern day minecraft server list
but for the older versions of minecraft.
